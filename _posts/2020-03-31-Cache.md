## Overview

Cache Memory is a special very high-speed memory. It is used to speed up and synchronizing with high-speed CPU. Cache memory is costlier than main memory or disk memory but economical than CPU registers. Cache memory is an extremely fast memory type that acts as a buffer between RAM and the CPU. It holds frequently requested data and instructions so that they are immediately available to the CPU when needed.

Cache memory is used to reduce the average time to access data from the Main memory. The cache is a smaller and faster memory which stores copies of the data from frequently used main memory locations. There are various different independent caches in a CPU, which store instructions and data.

## Cache Performance

When the processor needs to read or write a location in main memory, it first checks for a corresponding entry in the cache.

- If the processor finds that the memory location is in the cache, a cache hit has occurred and data is read from cache
- If the processor does not find the memory location in the cache, a cache miss has occurred. For a cache miss, the cache allocates a new entry and copies in data from main memory, then the request is fulfilled from the contents of the cache.

The performance of cache memory is frequently measured in terms of a quantity called Hit ratio.

```
Hit ratio = hit / (hit + miss) =  no. of hits/total accesses
```
We can improve Cache performance using higher cache block size, higher associativity, reduce miss rate, reduce miss penalty, and reduce Reduce the time to hit in the cache.
## Cache organization 
Consider a computer system where each memory address has m bits that form $M = 2^m$ unique addresses. As illustrated in Figure below, a cache for such a machine is organized as an array of $S = 2^s$ cache sets. Each set consists of E cache lines. Each line consists of a data block of $B = 2^b$ bytes, a valid bit that indicates whether or not the line contains meaningful information, and $t = m − (b + s)$ tag bits (a subset of the bits from the current block’s memory address) that uniquely identify the block stored in the cache line. In general, a cache’s organization can be characterized by the tuple $(S, E, B, m)$. The size (or capacity) of a cache, C, is stated in terms of the aggregate size of all the blocks. The tag bits and valid bit are not included. Thus, $C = S × E × B$.

## Cache Mapping
Cache mapping is kind of like hash algorithm. It is used to determine which block of cache memory that a certain memory address should be put into.
There are three different types of mapping used for the purpose of cache memory depending on the *E* or number of cache lines per set, which are as follows: Direct mapping (E = 1), Set-Associative mapping(1 < E < C/B), and  Fully Associative mapping (E = C/B). These are explained below.

1. **Direct Mapping**  
   The simplest technique, known as direct mapping, maps each block of main memory into only one possible cache line($E = 1$, so each group has only one line). 
   
   The process that a cache goes through of determining whether a request is a hit or a miss and then extracting the requested word consists of three steps: *(1) set selection, (2) line matching, and (3) word extraction.*

2. **Set-associative Mapping**   
for cache with E that 1< E < C/B, we usually call it E-way associative caches.
This form of mapping is an enhanced form of direct mapping where the drawbacks of direct mapping are removed (in terms to cache conflicts). Set associative addresses the problem of possible thrashing in the direct mapping method. It does this by saying that instead of having exactly one line that a block can map to in the cache, we will group a few lines together creating a set. Then a block in memory can map to any one of the lines of a specific set..Set-associative mapping allows that each word that is present in the cache can have two or more words in the main memory for the same index address. Set associative cache mapping combines the best of direct and fully associative cache mapping techniques.

3. **Fully Associative Mapping**  
In this type of mapping, the associative memory is used to store content and addresses of the memory word. Any block can go into any line of the cache (There are only one set). This means that the word id bits are used to identify which word in the block is needed, but the tag becomes all of the remaining bits. This enables the placement of any word at any place in the cache memory. It is considered to be the fastest and the most flexible mapping form. However, it is very expensive to implemented this in hardware, so the size of this type of cache are usually small, such as TLB(Translation Lookaside Buffer) in virtual memory system.

## Write Strategy

Suppose we write a word w that is already cached (a write hit). After the cache updates its copy of w, what does it do about updating the copy of w in the next lower level of the hierarchy? The simplest approach, known as *write-through*, is to immediately write w’s cache block to the next lower level. While simple, write-through has the disadvantage of causing bus traffic with every write.   
Another approach, known as *write-back*, defers the update as long as possible by writing the updated block to the next lower level only when it is evicted from the cache by the replacement algorithm. Because of locality, write-back can significantly reduce the amount of bus traffic, but it has the disadvantage of additional complexity. The cache must maintain an additional *dirty bit* for each cache line that indicates whether or not the cache block has been modified.   
Another issue is how to deal with write misses. One approach, known as *writeallocate*, loads the corresponding block from the next lower level into the cache and then updates the cache block. Write-allocate tries to exploit spatial locality of writes, but it has the disadvantage that every miss results in a block transfer from the next lower level to the cache. The alternative, known as no-write-allocate, bypasses the cache and writes the word directly to the next lower level. Writethrough caches are typically no-write-allocate. Write-back caches are typically write-allocate.


## Locality 

Since size of cache memory is less as compared to main memory. So to check which part of main memory should be given priority and loaded in cache is decided based on locality of reference.

Locality is typically described as having two distinct forms: temporal locality and spatial locality. In a program with good temporal locality, a memory location that is referenced once is likely to be referenced again multiple times in the near future. In a program with good spatial locality, if a memory location is referenced once, then the program is likely to reference a nearby memory location in the near future.

 - Programs that repeatedly reference the same variables enjoy good temporal locality. . For programs with stride-k reference patterns, the smaller the stride, the better the spatial locality. 
 - Programs with stride-1 reference patterns have good spatial locality. Programs that hop around memory with large strides have poor spatial locality. 
 - Loops have good temporal and spatial locality with respect to instruction fetches. The smaller the loop body and the greater the number of loop iterations, the better the locality.
